-create the project
=> npm init

-install packages like  express , 
=>npm install express nodemon body-parser dotenv mongoose

Run the project using npm start app.js  or configure the nodemon in "scripts" to automatically fetch the changes in the file app.js

Then open the teminal in current project and one time do "npm start"   , next time it will fetch changes and run automatically

=>Now we are going to use express to create the server (previous done by http in node.js )

Basically creating another folder routes to manage routes. Import the modules of express, router , etc.

router.get("/" , (request , response ) =>{
    response.send("Your Routing is working good ")
});


-Also in main app.js file we can use these routes by importing their modules/packages.
app.use("/api/v1/courses/" , coursesRouter)



-Installing Thunder client extension , its just like the post Man to make request to the apis (apis are the url which perform some CRUD operations )


-Now creating the configuration file to keep all the constant together . " .env " and give the port number there.
import this first.
require("dotenv").config()
-then use the constants  by "process.env.PORT"

-Download the Offline Mongo DB as online is not working currently. in Nodejs (Refer mongo Db in one Video to download )

-Now i have dowload the Version 6 , so its does not have mongo.exe file , so just download lower version of 5.0.5 .Again and install it. 

(Otherwise temporary solution is to get CompassApp and mongosh shell ) and use it .


-Now to Connect the DB MongoDB locally  . We have use the url like this in .env


-Now crating model to store the data .

{
  "title":"JAva",
  "content":"Good Language",
  "videos":500,
  "active":true
  
}
